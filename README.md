Context Flag
============

Hi, if you're looking here for a module to use you're probably not really in the
right place. The actual home for this is the [Context Flag project page on 
Drupal.org](https://drupal.org/project/context_flag). 

This is just a mirror of the official codebase over there.

You can still browse the codebase in the [7.x-1.x branch](https://github.com/mraichelson/context_flag/tree/7.x-1.x) here.
